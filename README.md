# Why Sandbox Startups are failing

NOTE: Sandbox Startups will be referred to as any of the following phrases during the article: Roblox Clones, Shit Compendiums of Garbage, Sandbox Community (all startups), Sandbox Websites, etc

<br>


This article is written by a concerned member of the community surrounding tech startups such as (Brick-Hill.com)[https://brick-hill.com], (Brickplanet.com)[https://brickplanet.com], (Polytoria.com)[https://polytoria.com] and many others as most of these startup compaines, while they've maintained themselves from anywhere up to half a decade all the way up to just this year alone, they're all going to fail without some much needed bettering of their own comapines.

Although I, the author of this article, would prefer to stay anonymous, I'll give you a little context as to what I've done to try and better this community.

# Background

All in all, I'm a sandbox developer. Not one of your well recognized names like developers at Brickplanet or Brick-Hill as I am only a hobbyist but I've been around the sandbox block since 2017. I've viewed these sandbox startups from anywhere to literal flaming piles of dog shit to some of the most wholesome and home-like places I've ever found myself of being on the internet. Whenever I joined my very first roblox clone in 2017, I didn't anticipate that this would become a large portion of my life. In around 2020 whenever I started toying with the Unity Game Engine I familiarized myself with PHP and began creating my first sandbox websites in 2021. None of these were hosted until the summer of '22, nevertheless the experience is there. Of course, you didn't come to this article to read my portfolio but I've hosted these websites and I've personally seen my own apps crash and burn. Here's where you're going wrong as a sandbox owner.

# Community Outreach

The biggest and most common issue I have EVER seen a sandbox owner make, including myself, is community outreach. Whenever sandbox creators deploy their website for the first time, they're mainly advertising their website (if advertising at all) to people who are already familiar with websites of this nature. Essentially, most average sandboxes start out (and endup) as a social media platform with 3D avatars and no game client. You've essentially created a shitty version of Snapchat (if that makes any sense). If you've been running your sandbox for 6 months and only have about 50 daily active users, you're doing something wrong. You need to get your platform into the hands of your average consumer, someone who does not know anything about sandbox sites. 

## "How am I supposed to get my app in the hands of users?"

Advertising, tell your friends (REAL friends.), tell your siblings, tell your parents, tell a stranger. Set up some ads for your website. Advertise your website with shady methods. (not recommended, but hey, it's there.) Do ANYTHING to get the product into more people's hands. Hell, if you can attract Youtubers to your platform, although it's more than likely going to be negative, any publicity is good publicity. Take Brick-Hill for example, they had a Youtuber that now has 1.36 million subscribers do a positive take on their platform. I'll refer to this as the KonekoKitten Brick-Hill user influx event for the rest of this article.

# Target Audience

Although controversial, I would like to speak about target audience. Some sandbox creators have tried to use their target audience for other purposes, (ohio + spacebuilder = ohiobuilder, cough cough) but this is not what you should take away from this part of the article. I in no way condone pedophilia, I just want to help you succeed in running your businjess. Your target audience for sandbox sites should be people from anything to 13, all the way up to 20 years old. Anyone under 13 SHOULD be permitted on site although you should probably abide by COPPA (Federal United States Act known as Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) laws. Although this will probably sound daunting to some, if you do not follow these laws and you explicity allow for underage children to roam your platform you could face a maximum fine of 43.2k+ US dollars. Sandboxes best succeed with a target audience of teenagers, take Blox-City (2016 ver.) at its launch. It was extremely successful until its eventual shutdown because it had a platform that not only appealed to this target audience but also actually managed community outreach. 

# Revenue

Unless your website is a side-gig and you already have a job, prepare yourself as you're going to need money to run your platform. Most of these websites actually do have membership packages, but are executed poorly. To be honest, Roblox's idea to lock features behind a paywall with Roblox Premium (formerly Builder's Club) after they began to thrive with a userbase was actually a really good idea for a consistent revenue stream, although a little shitty on the receiving end. If you're going to paywall features, wait until you have a userbase to paywall. You don't want to force people to get a membership if there aren't people already using the platform. It's like creating a roadblock for ease of traffic on a road that's already empty. I wouldn't invest 100% of your revenue back into the website unless you absolutely have to. 

# Developers

To be honest, the most determined of developers could probably create a website, 3D renderer and client all on their own. This would probably require a lot of effort put fourth and a lot of time spent so if you decide to go this route, be absolutely sure of it. Of course, at any point in that route you could assemble a team of developers which is what I recommend you do if you haven't already. Burnout is a strong deterrant if you put too much work on yourself. 

Assembling a team of experienced developers who fit your needs is challenging especially in this community, but most work without want for pay so I guess you have that going for you.

# People rarely want Economy Simulators

If your website has no client, you're essentially an economy and trade simulator with a forum. This is how most sandboxes operate, and it baffles me how these sites can get so far before collapsing. This is really what the first sandbox startups started as, until they developed their game clients. People want a product. You're not selling a forum and some virtual hats, you're selling games. You're selling a dedicated community. A game client doesn't even have to be an external application. I've seen a 2D sandbox ( I've forgotten the name :( ) that ran completely off of custom networking and the Javascript canvas. It was surprisingly really fun. You don't have to think inside the box for your game, be creative and original with it. That also brings us to our next topic.

# Originality

PEOPLE. DO. NOT. WANT. ANOTHER. BRICKPLANET.

I've seen people literally rip Brickplanet's 2017 frontend, slap it onto an open-source or skidded repo like LRC and call it a day. That is not effort. That is sad. That is not original. That is shit. To be original, by definition, means:

"Preceding all others in time; first."

"Not derived from something else; fresh and unusual."

"Showing a marked departure from previous practice; new."

All of those scream SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE. Be original in EVERYTHING you do. To be original, is to be unique. Unique is good. You want to build something that someone can just look at and recognize. Build something that someone can look at and appreciate. Build something that nobody else has done. That is what it means to be original, that is what it means to be unique.
